## A.1 Compilation on your system
Now The primitive equations and the semi-implicit timestep
DREAM solves the primitive equations expressed in terms of vorticity and divergence. These are written down in Hoskins and Simmons (1975, HS75) but letâ€™s deciphier this presentation by approaching  them from the momentum equations, using subscript notation for partial derivatives:

$$
   \begin{eqnarray}
      u_t - fv &=& -uu_x - vu_y -wu_z - p_x/\rho \label{eqA1} \\
      v_t + fu &=& -uv_x - vv_y -wv_z - p_y/\rho \label{eqA2}
   \end{eqnarray}
$$

then,

$$
   \begin{equation}
      \partial/\partial x (A2) - \partial/\partial y (A1)
   \end{equation}
$$
